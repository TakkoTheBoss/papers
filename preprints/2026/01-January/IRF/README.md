# Intent Realization Fidelity (IRF)

This repository hosts the preprint of the paper:

**Intent Realization Fidelity: Verifying That Systems Do What They Claim**

The paper introduces IRF as a system property describing the degree to which
declared intent is faithfully realized at the lowest level where its effects
materially manifest, verified through independent evidence rather than self-reporting.

This work is conceptual and analytical in nature and does not propose specific
algorithms or implementations.
